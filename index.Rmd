# Text mining with R : A Tidy Model Approach

This book uses tidy data principle for (text mining using)[https://www.tidytextmining.com/] an R package called tidytext by Julia Silge and David Robinson.

I used to read books passively, but I realised I dont realy engaged with the contents. I therefore, decided to summarize all the books I read, that way, I will fully engaged with contents of the book and practice all the code and ideas in the boook.
